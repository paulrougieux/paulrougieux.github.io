# Humour

Prompt:

> Why are you so bad at humour? Why are your jokes so lame?

GPT4

> I apologize for my lackluster attempts at humor. My training data includes a 
> broad range of content, but comedy is a complex, nuanced form of human 
> expression that is difficult for algorithms to master. Humor often relies on 
> timing, context, and shared cultural or social experiences that a machine 
> like me can't fully grasp.

> Additionally, humor can be highly subjective. What one person finds 
> hilarious, another might not find amusing at all. I aim to provide humor that 
> is broad and unlikely to offend, which might make it seem "lame" to some.

> Thank you for your feedback, and I'll keep striving to improve!
