## Common work

- pull
- make changes to the files
- add the files you want to commit
- commit your changes with a commit message


## What if there is updated work on the remote branch and you forgot to pull?

In case of work updated on the remote main branch but you have already
committed some changes on your local main branch, you will get an error
message. 

There are 2 options to deal with this:

- merge your yellow changes into a new commit called the "merge commit"

- rebase your yellow changes on top of the existing commits illustrated in red
  on the right. Rebase requires a little bit of discipline because you have to
  have a clear repository before you pull. 


## Will I loose my data if I pull?

Just to reassure you about not loosing your data, you can always pull before
committing (in fact it is a good idea to do so, to avoid the merge or rebase
above). Git will stop and emit a warning in case the remote changes would
overwrite files that you modified on your side. And most importantly, git will
keep your changed files as is.
