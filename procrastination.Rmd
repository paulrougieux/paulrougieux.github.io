    > "Switching Tasks Feels Impossible Some people with ADHD experience 
    > **hyperfocus**, which makes switching away from a task difficult. When 
    > this occurs, try setting a visible break timer to signal transitions. 
    > Building in a short transition activity between tasks, such as standing, 
    > stretching, or walking, can ease the shift between focus modes and reduce 
    > cognitive friction. It may also help to use auditory cues or gentle 
    > alarms that fade in, rather than loud timers that cause stress or 
    > confusion. Creating a consistent environment for work and rest also 
    > supports smoother transitions."
    > **The Urge to Extend Work Periods** One of the common pitfalls when using 
    > the Pomodoro Technique is the temptation to keep working past the 
    > 25-minute limit. While it may feel productive in the moment, extending 
    > work sessions can lead to burnout and reduce long-term efficiency. For 
    > individuals with ADHD, adhering to the set work intervals is vital for 
    > maintaining consistent energy levels and supporting the brain’s natural 
    > need for regular stimulation and rest. Longer stretches of unbroken 
    > concentration can also increase the risk of hyperfocus, making it harder 
    > to shift attention when necessary. By sticking to shorter, defined 
    > sessions, users allow their brains to reset and return with renewed 
    > focus. This supports better attention regulation and reduces the build-up 
    > of mental fatigue over time."
