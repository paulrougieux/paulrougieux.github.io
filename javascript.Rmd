- https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-provide-a-short-descrip-7PlVT6OlTMqCquc7J8vWBg#1

    > "You donâ€™t need to manually compress CSV files. Servers and browsers 
    > handle it automatically. When a user requests your file, the server 
    > applies HTTP compression (e.g. gzip or Brotli), the browser decompresses 
    > it, and your javascript libraries just receives plain CSV data without 
    > noticing."
