This is a description of how I edit text files for persons looking at my screen 
and wondering what editor I use to move so fast. Does a text editor still 
matter in the age of AI?

Let me describe my text editing setup. This text was written by a human with 
his fingers on a keyboard in Vim.


# Text editing

I use Vim or Neovim to edit markdown files and source code. Mostly python code 
as of 2025, occasionally R code or other programming languages as well.

When editing python code, the most used shortcut is `<leaderkey>p` which sends 
a paragraph to the ipython read–eval–print loop (REPL). This shortcut uses 
[vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) to "grab some text and send 
it to a target" tmux pane.
