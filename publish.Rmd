## Conjunctions

### Linking words

Example [50 linking words to use in academic 
writting](https://www.eliteediting.com.au/50-linking-words-to-use-in-academic-writing/)

> **Describing similarities**: likewise, correspondingly, equally, not only…
> but also, in the same way, similarly

> **Showing cause and effect**: consequently, as a result, thus, hence (never
> ‘hence why’), since (try to avoid ‘as’ when showing cause and effect),
> because, therefore, accordingly, this suggests that, it follows that, for
> this reason 

> **Comparing and contrasting**: alternatively, however, conversely, on the
> other hand, instead, yet, on the contrary

> **Showing limitation or contradiction**: despite/in spite of, while (not
> whilst!), even so, on the contrary, nevertheless, nonetheless, although,
> admittedly 

> **Emphasis, addition or examples**: to illustrate, to clarify, further (not
> ‘furthermore’), first, second and third (not firstly, secondly and thirdly),
> for instance, moreover, typically, especially, in fact, namely, in addition

> **Concluding**: to summarise, it can be concluded that, as can be seen,
> ultimately, given the above, as described, finally

Blog explanation from Grammarly [on the use of
firstly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/firstly/)

> It is not wrong to use firstly, secondly, and so on to enumerate your points.
> Nor is it wrong to use the simpler first, second, etc. 

> I have three reasons for wanting to visit Rome. Firstly, I would love to see
> the Colosseum. Secondly, I’m sure the pope is dying to meet me. Thirdly, they
> have great pizza. 

> I have three reasons for wanting to visit Rome. First, I would love to see
> the Colosseum. Second, I’m sure the pope is dying to meet me. Third, I need
> better pizza. 

> "These statements are equivalent in meaning. Nevertheless, there are good
> reasons for choosing the “first” sequence over the “firstly” sequence. First,
> using first is a sure win. If your writing is being published or evaluated,
> or even if you would like to seem proficient to your coworkers, use the
> construction that is never criticized rather than the one that is frequently
> criticized."


### Coordinating conjunctions

academicguides.waldenu.edu 
[conjunctions](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/conjunctions)

> "Coordinating conjunctions connect words or phrases that serve the same grammatical purpose in a sentence. There are seven main coordinating conjunctions in English, which form the acronym FANBOYS:

> F: for: The teachers were frustrated, for the school had cut funding for all 
>    enrichment programs.

> A: and: In this course, I will write a literature review, a case study, and a final 
>    paper.

> N: nor: The students did not complete their homework, nor did they pass the test.

> B: but: The study is several years old but still valuable to this study.

> O: or: At the end of the class, the students can choose to write an essay or take a test.

> Y: yet: The patient complained of chronic pain, yet she refused treatment.

> S: so: I have only been a nurse for one year, so I have little experience with paper 
     charting.*


### Subordinating conjunctions

academicguides.waldenu.edu 
[conjunctions](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/conjunctions)

Subordinating conjunctions join a subordinate clause to a main clause and establishes a relationship between the two. There are many subordinating clauses, but here are some of the most common:

    after, although, as much as/as soon as/as long as, as though, because, before, how, 
    if, in order to/in order that, once, since, than, that, though, unless, until, 
    when/whenever, where/wherever, whether, while


### That as a conjunction for noun clauses

academicguides.waldenu.edu 
[conjunctions](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/conjunctions)

> "For example,
>
>    Smith (2015) reported that more research was necessary.
>        Smith (2015) = subject
>        reported = verb
>        that more research was necessary = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "reported"
>    The authors hypothesized that there would be significant results.
>        The authors = subject
>        hypothesized = verb
>        that there would be significant results = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "hypothesized"
>    Jones (2014) asserted that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study.
>        Jones (2014) = subject
>        asserted = verb
>        that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study = dependent clause, direct object of the verb "asserted"
>    Rephrasing these sentences into questions and answers is one way to see that the "that" clauses are acting as direct objects.
>        What did Smith (2015) report?
>            Answer: that more research was necessary
>        What did the authors hypothesize?
>            Answer: that there would be significant results
>        What did Jones (2014) assert?
>            Answer: that confidentiality was maintained throughout the study
>
> In formal written English, for clarity, most academic writers choose to keep "that" 
> when it introduces a noun clause (Caplan, 2012). Leaving out "that" can cause the 
> reader to misread (at first anyway) the subject of the dependent clause as being the 
> object of the reporting verb (Jamieson, 2012).
>
> For example, if readers see the sentence, "Smith (2015) reported more research was 
> necessary (without 'that')," they may understand “more research” as the thing Smith 
> reported and then have to backtrack and reread upon seeing “was necessary.”
> Any structure that leads to misinterpretation, even temporarily, can be an unwanted 
> distraction from the writer’s message.
> In spoken English, however, "that" may be dropped in such sentences. (Intonation 
> patterns—rising and falling pitch—give the listener clues that may not be present in 
> writing.)"

Paul's reply

Yes I have the feeling the analysis can slip very quickly into a wider and
wider questioning, leading nowhere. Hopefully some form of spinal chord comes
out of our brain storming.

In the bst file, you can also check for chapter entries.

### Compilation errors

Error message:

    ! Argument of \UTFviii@two@octets has an extra }.

Tex.stackexchange [answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/372332/44254)
Change ü to {\"u} in Düsseldorf in the bibliography.


## Diff

Install Latex diff on Debian: 

    sudo apt install latexdiff


### Latexdiff and git


#### Latexdiff-git 

Latexdiff can handle files in version control systems. I didn't know this and
checked out the old file by hand before performing the comparison. First I
describe the way I should have done it as explained in man latexdiff-vc

    latexdiff-git -r rev1 -r rev2 eutr_impact.tex
    mv eutr_impact-diff*.tex eutr_impact.tex
    latexmk -pdf -bibtex -f template.tex

You can also use `--flatten`:

> "The generic usage of this function is : "latexdiff-vc --flatten -r rev1 [-r
> rev2] master.tex" where master.tex is the project file containing the highest
> level of includes etc." 

       latexdiff-git --flatten -r 5445bfd -r b47fefa template.tex
       latexmk -pdf -bibtex -f template-diff5445bfd-b47fefa.tex

But that document didn't compile for some reason. So I used the solution above
with the diff made on the sub-document subsequently moved to another document.

#### Without latexdiff-git

Old way of doing things without using the latexdiff-vc helper. Generate diff
version of latex files. In the instructions below, the manuscript was made of 2
documents `template.tex ` which called `\input{content.tex}`.

Checkout contents from commit 9ce6b9 on 2020 December 1st and prepare the diff in the /tmp dir:

    # Delete and re-create a temp dir and copy everything in it
    rm -rf /tmp/article_diff/
    cp -r ~/repos/article_pub /tmp/article_diff
    # Copy the old and new versions of the manuscript to the tmp folder
    cd ~/repos/article_pub/latex_template
    git show 9ce6b9:./content.tex > /tmp/article_diff/latex_template/content_before_review.tex
    git show 9ce6b9:./template.tex > /tmp/article_diff/latex_template/template_before_review.tex
    cp content.tex /tmp/article_diff/latex_template/content_now.tex
    cp template.tex /tmp/article_diff/latex_template/template_now.tex

Generate the diff

    cd /tmp/article_diff/latex_template
    latexdiff template_before_review.tex template_now.tex > template.tex
    latexdiff content_before_review.tex content_now.tex > content.tex

Compile the diff document, enter quiet mode with “Q” if there are error messages

     latexmk -pdf -bibtex -use-make template.tex

## Makefile

Make can be use to automate the compilation of the latex file, place the
supporting figures and documents in a zip archive and subsequently remove the
intermediate files.

    # Usage:
    # make        # Generate the pdf and zip files for the submission. 
    # make render # Render the pdf, keep all automatically generated files for Latex diagnostics.
    # make clean  # Keep a copy of the pdf one level above and remove automatically generated files.
    # make zip    # Generate the zip archive of the article and figures for the submission process.
    #
    all: render clean zip

    render:
         latexmk -pdf -bibtex -use-make forests-1032372-proofreading.tex

    clean:
         cp forests-1032372-proofreading.pdf ../manuscript.pdf || echo "forests-1032372-proofreading.tex not there."
         git clean -xf

    zip: # Remove the zip archive otherwise deleted files will remain in the archive and it will be simply updated
         rm ../manuscript.zip ../figures.zip || echo "No existing zip archive to delete."
         zip ../manuscript.zip -r *
         zip ../figures.zip -r figures/*
         echo "Verify that the pdf and zip archives have been updated by checking their update time."
         ls -lh ../*.zip
	     ls -lh ../*.pdf

> [It] was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he
> was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and
