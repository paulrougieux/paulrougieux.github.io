# Introduction

This page is the continuation of [my blog post on GNU-Linux bash shell
commands](https://paulremote.blogspot.de/2014/01/linux-shell-commands.html).

Linux is the kernel of the operating system on top of which other programs are
built. A detailed list of GNU core utilities is available under the command :

    info coreutils 

The page below also contains many commands from external tools 
that are not part of the GNU project.

# Command history

To search within previous commands, press CTRL+R and start typing words contained in the previous command. 

If you accidentally press CTRL+S the [terminal will hang](https://askubuntu.com/a/264253/315347)
Press `CTRL+Q` to regain control.
See also [Ctrl-s hang terminal emulator?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/72086/ctrl-s-hang-terminal-emulator)
which provides a workaround: entering `stty -ixon` in .bashrc. 

# Convert

This section is about converting from one document format into another. For
example converting a text file into a pdf file and vice-versa.

## Audio

Convert from Wav to mp3 [seen in this
gist](https://gist.github.com/championofblocks/3982727)

    for i in *.WAV; do test -f "${i%.WAV}.mp3" || lame -b 320 -h "${i}" "${i%.WAV}.mp3"; done


## Clipboard

[Pipe to from the clipboard in bash
script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/749544/pipe-to-from-the-clipboard-in-bash-script)

For example copy the readme file to the clipboard used by CTRL+C CTRL+V:

    xclip -selection c README.md


## Images to pdf

Convert one or more images to pdf

    img2pdf img.jpg -o output.pdf 

The help page `man img3pd` explains the arguments

> Convert a directory of JPEG images into a PDF with printable A4 pages in
> landscape mode. On each page, the photo takes the maximum amount of space
> while preserving its aspect ratio and a print border of 2 cm on the top and
> bottom and 2.5 cm on the left and right hand side.

    img2pdf --output out.pdf --pagesize A4^T --border 2cm:2.5cm *.jpg
 
>  Appending ^T (a caret/circumflex followed by the letter T) turns the paper
>  size from portrait into land‐ scape.

I used the following instruction to create an A4 page with 2 images one jpg and
one png

    img2pdf image1.jpg image2.png -o output.pdf --pagesize A4^T --border 1cm
    img2pdf image1.jpg image2.png -o output.pdf --pagesize A4 --border 1cm
    img2pdf *.jpg -o output.pdf --pagesize A4 --border 1cm

Interestingly when I asked for landscape mode, only the second image appeared
in landscape. When I asked for portrait mode, only the second image appeared in
portrait mode. The first jpg image contained exif orientation metadata (it was
rotated vertically). Opening the first image in Gimp, rotating it and exporting it
under a new name (without the exif metadata) solves the issue. Both pages are
portrait A4.

Convert [all jpg images in the current
directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8955425/how-can-i-convert-a-series-of-images-to-a-pdf-from-the-command-line-on-linux)
to a pdf 

    img2pdf $(find . -iname '*.jpg' | sort -V) -o ./document.pdf  

If there is an alpha layer in the image, it will not be added to the pdf. The
Warning message suggests using imagemagick to remove the alpha layer.

    WARNING:root:Image contains transparency which cannot be retained in PDF.
    WARNING:root:img2pdf will not perform a lossy operation.
    WARNING:root:You can remove the alpha channel using imagemagick:
    WARNING:root:  $ convert input.png -background white -alpha remove -alpha off output.png
    ERROR:root:error: Refusing to work on images with alpha channel


### Images from a zip folder to a pdf document

Unzip the archive containing jpeg images into a temporary folder, reduce the
image sizes to 2000 pixel wide and generate a pdf.

    mkdir -p /tmp/bli/newfolder
    cd /tmp/bli/
    unzip ~/downloads/fwdbungenfrfrderunterrichtfrdienchstenstunden.zip
    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./newfolder *.jpeg
    cd newfolder/
    img2pdf *.jpeg -o output.pdf --pagesize A4 --border 1cm
    echo "The pdf document containing all images is located at: /tmp/bli/output.pdf"


## Images to other formats

Convert a png image to a jpgeg image

    convert canto_dei_sanfedisti.png canto_dei_sanfedisti.jpg

Convert a png image with an alpha layer to an image without alpha layer

    convert input.png -background white -alpha remove -alpha off output.png

Convert from png to jpg and change size

    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./newfolder -format jpg *.png

Only change format 

    mogrify  -path ./newfolder -format jpg *.png

See also more image modification commands in the edit image files section below.


## Documents between various formats with Pandoc

[Pandoc demos](https://pandoc.org/demos.html) contains a lot of example commands 
to convert text files from one format to another.
[Pandoc user guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)

Convert a markdown document to pdf

    pandoc filname.md -o filename.pdf
    # If there are utf-8 encoding issues, use another engine
    pandoc readings_jrc.md -o readings_jrc.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex

Convert an odt document to markdown

    pandoc filename.odt -o filename.md 

Convert a Microsoft Word document to markdown

    pandoc filename.docx -o filename.md 

Convert a Microsoft Word document to markdown and keep images

    pandoc --extract-media figures input.docx -o output.md

Images are contained in a `media` subfolder in Word documents, the instruction
above leads to a `figure/media` sub folder. To avoid this [use the current
directory path](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52593892/2641825)

    pandoc --extract-media=. input.docx -o output.md

Convert an html code snippets to markdown and display the output at the command line

    echo "Link: <a href="https://www.linphone.org/">Linphone</a>"| pandoc -f html -t markdown
    # Link: [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/)

Convert an entire web page to markdown

    pandoc https://pandoc.org/help.html -t markdown

[Markdown has two different header
styles](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#headers) The default is to use
setext-style headers for levels 1-2, and then ATX headers. To use ATX style
headers only in markdown output:

    pandoc --atx-headers filename.docx -o filename.md 


### Yaml front matter for styles

#### Bibliography

Custom yaml front matter for a markdown document that contains reading notes
with citations. See also the vim.Rmd document on pandoc bibliographies.

    ---
    title: Reading notes
    author: Paul Rougieux
    bibliography: /home/paul/rp/bioeconomy_papers/bibliography/jrc_ispra.bib
    abstract: Reading notes at the JRC
    header-includes: |
        \usepackage{fancyhdr}
        \pagestyle{fancy}
        \fancyhead[CO,CE]{Reading notes}
        \fancyfoot[CO,CE]{JRC}
        \fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
    ---
    \tableofcontents{}
    ...file content... this is probably not the way to do it    
    \bibliography{../bibliography/jrc_ispra}
    \bibliographystyle{apalike}

This is probably not the way to do it, the bibliography should be included in the pandoc call? 
Note this requires citeproc

    sudo apt install pandoc-citeproc

Then this should work :

    pandoc readings_jrc.md -o readings_jrc.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex --bibliography=jrc_ispra.bib

There is still an issue with the encoding of the bibliography.

#### Margins and font size

Change the margin to 0.5 cm

    ---
    title: "Songs of freedom"
    author: "Bob Marley"
    geometry: margin=0.5cm
    ---

Change the font to 12pt, the max available in the default template.

    ---
    fontsize: 12pt
    ---

To get bigger fonts (up to 20pt) as explained in this [SO
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46055046), you can use the `extsizes`
package by adding `documentclass: extarticle`.

#### Page numbers

Adding headers and footers to pandoc suggests using:

    ---
    title: Test
    author: Author Name
    header-includes: |
        \usepackage{fancyhdr}
        \pagestyle{fancy}
        \fancyhead[CO,CE]{This is fancy}
        \fancyfoot[CO,CE]{So is this}
        \fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
    abstract: This is a pandoc test . . . 
    ---


#### Table of content 

Add a table of content at the beginning of the document

    ---
    title: "Work plan"
    geometry: margin=2cm
    toc: yes
    ---

When specified in the yaml front matter only, the table of content appears in pdf output but not in html output. This may be
due to a difference in the latex and html templates? Display the
content of the latex and html templates
    
    pandoc -D latex
    pandoc -D html

However calling the --toc argument does create a table of content in the html file:

    pandoc -s --toc notes.md -o notes.html

#### Two column layout and class options

The `openany` option for the book document class, allows opening a chapter on any
page left or right, otherwise the book class forces chapter opening on the left
page only and inserts a blank page.

    ---
    title: "Songs"
    geometry: margin=0.5cm
    documentclass: book
    classoption:
    - twocolumn
    - openany
    ---


### Bash script for bulk conversion

Convert many markdown files with this [bash script for
pandoc](https://github.com/FHefner/pandoc-docs/blob/master/pandoc-docs) 

    for mdfile in *.md; do
    pdffile=${mdfile%.md}.pdf
    echo $pdffile
    done

Convert all docx documents to markdown in the current folder

    for docxfile in *.docx; do
    mdfile=${docxfile%.docx}.md
    echo "converting $docxfile to $mdfile"
    pandoc "$docxfile" -o "$mdfile"
    done

Pandoc can convert to PDF, but not from PDF.

You can also create template files as explained in super user [markdown to latex conversion with a custom preamble](https://superuser.com/questions/356032/markdown-to-latex-conversion-with-a-custom-preamble-using-pandoc/356044#356044)

See also the makefile for pandoc in the programming with bash / makefile
section below.

## Pdf to text with pdfminer

(pdfminer](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six)
Convert all pdf documents to text files in the current folder:

    for pdffile in *.pdf; do
    txtfile=${pdffile%.pdf}.txt
    echo "converting $pdffile to $txtfile"
    pdf2txt.py $pdffile > $txtfile
    done

See also a utility to extract tables from pdf documents.

## Pdf to tables with tabula

Extract tables from a pdf with [tabula](https://tabula.technology/)

    cd /home/paul/Downloads/tabula-jar-1.2.1/tabula
    java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -Xms256M -Xmx1024M -jar tabula.jar

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/

# Copy files

To copy a file from /tmp/file.md to /tmp/file2.md

    cp /tmp/file.md /tmp/file2.md


## Rsync 

Rsync man page:

> Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It can copy
> locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote
> rsync daemon. [...] It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which
> reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the
> differences between the source files and the existing files in the
> destination. Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an
> improved copy command for everyday use.

The most important option is -a:

    -a, --archive archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)

The option `-a` does all of the following:

    -r, --recursive             recurse into directories
    -l, --links                 copy symlinks as symlinks
    -p, --perms                 preserve permissions
    -t, --times                 preserve modification times
    -g, --group                 preserve group
    -o, --owner                 preserve owner (super-user only)
        --devices               preserve device files (super-user only)
        --specials              preserve special files
    -D                          same as --devices --specials

Other options I have used: 

    -v, --verbose increase verbosity, use -vv for more verbose.
    -z, --compress compress file data during the transfer


To sync [only some file
extensions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11111793/2641825)

> "So if we only want `*.sh` files we have to exclude all files `--exclude="*"`,
> include all directories `--include="*/"` and include all `*.sh` files
> `--include="*.sh"`."

Sync only `.mdb` files that are the output of a model

    rsync -zav --include="*/" --include="*.mdb" --exclude="*"  /home/paul/rp/cbmcfs3_data/scenarios/static_demand/ edartrade:static_demand/


### Slash or no slash

> "A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating an
> additional directory level at the destination. You can think of a trailing /
> on a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed to
> "copy the directory by name", but in both cases the attributes of the
> containing directory are transferred to the containing directory on the
> destination. In other words, each of the follow‐ ing commands copies the
> files in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of
> /dest/foo: "

    rsync -av /src/foo /dest
    rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo


## Flatten a file hierarchy

Copy all files in the folder hierarchy to a flat folder at the root.
[solution from
askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/633945/how-can-i-merge-multiple-directories-into-one)

    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I file mv --backup=numbered file .

I also follow with [another
command](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/371393/85530)  

    rename 's/((?:\..+)?)\.~(\d+)~$/_$2$1/' *.~*~

to keep the numbering of duplicated files before the extension. 


# Count

## Number of files

[Recursively count the number of files in a
directory](https://askubuntu.com/a/370717/315347), limiting the maximum depth

    find -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l

Counting files with a specific extension

    find -name '*.csv' |wc -l
    find -name '*.ogg' |wc -l

[Recursively counting files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9157162/2641825)

    find DIR_NAME -type f | wc -l

## Number of lines in a text file
Count the number of lines in a file

    wc -l filename.txt 

Count the number of lines in all files, and give the total line count.

    find . -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l # python code
    find . -name '*.R' | xargs wc -l # R code

# DOS

Here are some DOS commands because sometimes you need to work on windows.

Remove directories recursively

    rmdir /S 

Show environmental variables

    echo %Path%


# Dot files

## Alias

    alias ll="ls -lh" 


Based on how can i sort du-h output by size

    alias du='du -hd1 | sort -h -r'


You can place those commands in your ~/.bashrc to create a permanent alias.
bashrc:

>    "You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly."

Alias from other persons: 

https://github.com/statox/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_aliases

Reload bash aliases:

    source ~/.bashrc


## Profile .bash_profile and .bashrc

These are places where a user can turn of the system BEEP :

    setterm -blength 0

.bash_profile is executed on login shell, when you login in another tty or when you access a system through ssh. .bashrc is executed on non-login shells when you open a terminal window in Gnome.

Debian Dotfiles

    "Now, since bash is being invoked as a login shell (with name "-bash", a special ancient hack), it reads /etc/profile first. Then it looks in your home directory for .bash_profile, and if it finds it, it reads that."

    [...] "You may have noted that .bashrc is not being read in this situation. You should therefore always have command source ~/.bashrc at the end of your .bash_profile in order to force it to be read by a login shell.  "

In .bashrc a user can set environment variables, define alias (see above).



# Download 

## Download with Curl

Curl man page:

> "curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
> supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS,
> LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS,
> TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction."

The "remote-name" argument or capital "-O" loads a file from a URL, using the
file name from the URL as explained in the curl man page.

> " -O, --remote-name Write  output  to  a  local file named like the remote
> file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
> off.)"

    curl -O <url_including_a_file_name>


## Download videos and audio

Install youtube-dl using pip:

     sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl

You may also need to install the ffmpeg package:

    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

Download a video from youtube :

    youtube-dl video_url

Download in a small format below 480 pixel height:

    youtube-dl  -f 'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio/best[height<=480]' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAtLTLiqNwg

The repetition of the hight in the audio part is needed, otherwise, there
will be no sound.

Download only the audio in an OGG Vorbis format

    youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format vorbis video_url

Download only the audio in an .mp3 format

    youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 video_url

Create bash aliases to download various audio formats from youtube

    alias youtubevorbis="youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format vorbis"
    alias youtubemp3="youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3"

If you encounter some Errors 403 forbidden, removing the cache might help

[error 403 with youtube-dl](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32104702/youtube-dl-library-and-error-403-forbidden-when-using-generated-direct-link-by)

## Parse html files for URLS

[How to use grep and cut in script to obtain website URLs from an HTML file](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/181254/how-to-use-grep-and-cut-in-script-to-obtain-website-urls-from-an-html-file)
Nice examples such as this one with decomposition 

    grep -Eoi '<a [^>]+>' source.html |
    grep -Eo 'href="[^\"]+"' | 
    grep -Eo '(http|https)://[^/"]+'

and this one which extracts all top level domain present in an html page 

    cat urls.html | grep -Eo "(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_-]*" | sort -u

This is how I extracted all links from an html file: 

    grep -Eo '(http|https)://[^"]+' Musicwelistento.html | sed -e  's/https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=//g' > song_links.txt


# Edit

## Edit Image files

### Resize

Resize a picture to 2000 px wide using ImageMagick:

    convert picture1.jpg -resize 2000 picture2.jpg 

Resize a picture to 2000 px wide and also convert it to gray scale:

    convert picture1.jpg -resize 2000 -type Grayscale picture2.jpg 

Batch processing, resize all jpg images and place the resized images in a new folder

    mkdir small
    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./small *.jpg
    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./small *.jpeg
    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./small/ *.JPG
    mogrify -resize 2000 -type Grayscale -path ./small *.jpg


### Convert

Convert to different color scheme, other file format or rotate images.

Convert to [black and white](http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=11279)
(tricky to get the threshold right): 

    convert picture1.jpg -threshold 40% picture2.jpg 

Other option to convert to black and white [good black and white bimodal
images](https://superuser.com/questions/75373/convert-color-photos-of-documents-to-good-black-and-white-bitonal-images):

    convert -monochrome in.png out.png

Batch processing, rotate all images clockwise or counter clockwise

    mogrify -rotate 90 ../small/ *.JPG
    mogrify -rotate 270 ../small/ *.JPG

Error: "cache resources exhausted" can appear in conversion of large images.

    sudo find / -name "policy.xml"

[SO
explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31407010/cache-resources-exhausted-imagemagick)
Edit the file as super user 

    sudo vim /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

Change

<policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="1GiB"/>

to 

<policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="4GiB"/>

Convert from png to jpg and change size

    mogrify -resize 2000 -path ./newfolder -format jpg *.png

### A4 portrait Scan emulation

Combine some of the commands above to create a scanned A4 portrait pdf document from

## Edit PDF files

### Combine PDF

Commands based on the poppler library for PDF manipulation.
Merge multiple PDF into one:

    pdfunite in-1.pdf in-2.pdf in-n.pdf out.pdf

Alternatively, pdftk can be used to merge PDF files

    pdftk input1.pdf input2.pdf cat output output.pdf

[Extract pages from a pdf](https://askubuntu.com/a/282455/315347)

    pdftk full-pdf.pdf cat 12-15 output outfile_p12-15.pdf

Also works with several distant groups of pages

    pdftk Accordeon-facile-Volume-3.pdf cat 10-11 14-17 30 output la_java_bleue.pdf

### Split PDF

Split a pdf in two

    mutool poster -x 2 cbmflow.pdf output.pdf
    # if necessary, install mutool with 
    apt install mupdf-tools


## Replace strings in text files
Replace strings

    first="I love Suzy and Mary"
    second="Sara"
    first=${first/Suzy/$second}

Replace strings with sed

    sed -i  's/pattern/replacement/g' bli.txt 

    sed -i  's/^.*\://g' input_file.txt # edit file in place
    grep EMAIL input_file.txt |sed  's/^.*\://g' > output_file.txt 

Add a line above and below a line that contains a particular string.
This was necessary for a Latex to Lyx document conversion. 
The Latex file had problematic characters in href links. 
Conversion  worked fine without the href links, to keep the links

I quoted them in `\begin{verbatim}` statements.

## Cron

In order to [use two differet /etc/hosts depending upon the
time](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/41496/two-different-etc-hosts-depending-upon-the-time),
I added the following to /etc/hosts_worktime:

    0.0.0.1 youtube.com

I then created a cron job that copies that files to /etc/hosts at 9am. Start
the crontab editor:

    crontab -e

Add these lines:

    0  9 * * 1-5 ln -f /etc/hosts_worktime /etc/hosts
    0 17 * * 1-5 ln -f /etc/hosts_playtime /etc/hosts

I initially used `cp` instead of `ln -f`, but it's better to make a hard link
so any subsequent modification of /etc/hosts will actually be kept in one of
the file, and not overwritten by the `cp`.
I noticed that youtube.com was still available for a little while after I
blocked it. I'm not sure it's necessary or if you simply need to wait a little
bit for the change to the hosts file to take effect. Anyway here is an
instruction to restart networking and clear the DNS cache: 

    sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

# Find

## Find files

Find files in subdirectories of the current directory (Quotes are requited to
prevent shell command expansion). Find files of a specific extension:

    find -name "*.pdf" 

Like -name, but the match is case insensitive

    find -iname "*phd*"

Find files of a specific modification time:

    find . -mtime 0 # modified in the last 24 hours

Find files [not having a specific extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1341467/find-filenames-not-ending-in-specific-extensions-on-unix):

    find . -type f -not -name '*.csv'
    # Alternative syntax
    find . -type f ! \( -name '*.csv' \)

Limit the depth of the search 

    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.pdf" 

Find files in the whole system

    locate filename

## Get information about a file

Determine file type and encoding. The -i option shows the mime type strings.

    file filename
    file -i filename

list a directory
```{bash}
ls
ls -R # list subdirectories recursively
ls -lh # sizes in human readable format
```

Display the [last modification date of a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16391208/print-a-files-last-modified-date-in-bash)

    date -r <filename>
    ls -l <filename>

More file information

    stat <filename>

## Search and filter text files

Search with Grep

    grep "text" file.txt

Recursive search (-r) in all files in the directory for a given pattern, case insensitive (-i)

    grep -ri "pattern" .

Give 1 line of context before and 2 lines of context after:

    grep -B 1 -A 2 pattern README.md

Search for lines containing "Done" or "encountered" only in specific log files recursively in a directory.
Also displays the line count at the end.

    grep -r Done --include runner.log | tee /dev/tty |wc -l
    grep -r encountered --include runner.log | tee /dev/tty |wc -l

Note: [How to pipe stdout while keeping it on screen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5677201/how-to-pipe-stdout-while-keeping-it-on-screen-and-not-to-a-output-file)

Show all csv files mentioned in a source code (supposing the csv file name contain only alphanumeric characters).
Use Extended regular expression (-E) to search for alphanumeric characters, 
only show the matching result (-o), not the full line 
and show the line number (-n) where the string occurs:

    grep -Eon "[[:alnum:]]+.csv" file.txt

Count occurrences of a word in a file

    grep -roh word filename.txt  | wc -w

[Awk tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html#uh-11), for example  filter a large file for lines that have a third field (product code) starting with 44, keep the header line:

    awk -F, '$3 ~ /^44/||NR==1' nc201501.dat|less

Regexp match beginning of and end of line with ^ and \$.

Follow the end of a log file as it is written 

    tail -f

See tab and end of line characters in a text file

    cat -te filename |less 


## Search in pdf files

Search a text pattern in all PDF files present in a directory:

    pdfgrep pattern *.pdf


# List files

List all files in a directory

    ls

List a file with its full path

    realpath README.md

To include dot files, pipe the output of `ls -a` to realpath:

    ls -a | xargs realpath

To list subdirectories recursively:

    ls -aR | xargs realpath

In case of you have spaces in file names, xargs recomments using the `-o`
option to prevent file names from being processed incorrectly, this works best
with the output of `find -print0` and it starts to look a lot more complex than
other answers: 

    find -print0 |xargs -0 realpath

The above is an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65002323/2641825) I posted
on Stackoverflow. See also a Unix and Linux stackexchange [question on how to
list all files in a directory with absolute
path](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/268474/how-to-list-all-files-in-a-directory-with-absolute-paths).


## Tree

List contents of a directories in a tree like format

    tree
    tree -d # List directories only, no files

Ignore files that contain compiled python bytecode with the `-I` option

    tree -I "*.pyc"

Show only python file matching the `"*.py"` pattern with the `-P` option

    tree -P "*.py"


# Networking

## Show IP addresses 

Show the IP address 

    ip addr show

Show the state of network interfaces

    ip link

Check open ports on a system

    nmap -Pn <hostname or IP address>


## Show domain name and host name

Show the domain name

    domainname

Show the host name

    hostname


# Open files and folders in the GUI

If bash is running inside a Graphical desktop environment, you can open the
current folder with

    xdg-open .

And open any file with the preferred application with for example

    xdg-open filename.pdf
    xdg-open filename.mp4

I created an alias in `.bash_aliases`

    alias open="xdg-open"

There is already an `open` command on some systems. But creating an alias for
it should be safe according to an answer to this [SO
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12329876/is-it-safe-to-alias-open-with-xdg-open) because "once you alias it, it's valid only for your user".

The alias makes it possible to open files with the simple command 

    open .


# Organise

## Compress and decompress files

Compress a file using gzip or 7z compression
    
    gzip <filename>
    7zr a -si<filename> <filename>.7z 

Decompress a single file from several archive formats:

    bzip2 -d <filename.bz2>
    gunzip <filename.gz>

[Askubuntu to extract a .tgz file with tar you need to use,](https://askubuntu.com/a/499809/315347)

    tar -xvzf /path/to/file.tgz
    tar -xvzf /path/to/file.tgz -C /path/where/to/extract/ 
    # Extract in a folder that has the archive name
    tar --extract -f /path/to/file.tgz --one-top-leve
    7zr e <filename.7z> # extract all files in the same directory 
    7zr x <filename.7z> # keep directory structure (see also multiple files below)

Convert a 7z file to gz using a pipe similar to [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/357980/419414).

    7zr e -so <filename.7z> | gzip -c > <filename.gz>

## Compress multiple files

How do I compress a whole directory?

    tar -zcvf archive-name.tar.gz directory-name 

Where

    -z: Compress archive using gzip program
    -c: Create archive
    -v: Verbose i.e display progress while creating archive
    -f: Archive File name

Decompress an archive containing multiple files
Keep full path of files within the archive
To extract content from the archive in the current directory

    tar -zxvf archive-name.tar.gz 
    7zr x <filename.7z>  

List content of an archive

    7zr l <filename.7z>

### Zip archive

Create the zip archive of a directory

    zip dir.zip -r dir

## Move and copy files

Copy a file

    cp file1 file2

[Recursive copy some files while keeping the directory structure](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83593/copy-specific-file-type-keeping-the-folder-structure)

    find . -name '*.csv' -exec cp --parents \{\} /target \;

## Rename files
For example to rename all upper-case .JPG extension into lower-case .jpg extension.

    rename 's/\.JPG$/\.jpg/' *.JPG

## To do lists

# Program with bash

## Makefile

I use GNU make and the following simple make file to generate all pages in this website:

    render:
         Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render_site()"


### Build an R package

The makefile below builds the FAOSTAT R package. I modified it from knitr's makefile.

    # Usage:
    # build the package's tarball, check and remove the ../FAOSTAT.Rcheck folder:
    # make
    # build the package's tarball and check (keep the ../FAOSTAT.Rcheck folder):
    # make check
    # generate the documentation:
    # make docs
    #
    # This makefile was copied and apdapted from  yihui / knitr 
    # https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/Makefile

    # prepare the package for release
    PKGNAME := $(shell sed -n "s/Package: *\([^ ]*\)/\1/p" DESCRIPTION)
    PKGVERS := $(shell sed -n "s/Version: *\([^ ]*\)/\1/p" DESCRIPTION)
    PKGSRC  := $(shell basename `pwd`)

    all: docs check clean

    deps:
        tlmgr install pgf preview xcolor;\
        Rscript -e 'if (!require("Rd2roxygen")) install.packages("Rd2roxygen", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")'

    docs:
        R -q -e "devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace', 'vignette'))"

    build:
        cd ..;\
        R CMD build $(PKGSRC)

    install: build
        cd ..;\
        R CMD INSTALL $(PKGNAME)_$(PKGVERS).tar.gz

    check: build
        cd ..;\
        R CMD check $(PKGNAME)_$(PKGVERS).tar.gz --as-cran

    clean:
        cd ..;\
        $(RM) -r $(PKGNAME).Rcheck/
        

### Compile a latex article

This make file compiles a latex article to pdf and generate a zip file
containing all documents necessary to generate the article and another zip file
containing the figures.

    # Usage:
    # make        # Generate the pdf and zip files for the submission. 
    # make render # Render the pdf, keep all automatically generated files for Latex diagnostics.
    # make clean  # Keep a copy of the pdf one level above and remove automatically generated files.
    # make zip    # Generate the zip archive of the article and figures for the submission process.
    #
    all: render clean zip

    render:
         latexmk -pdf -bibtex -use-make template.tex

    clean:
         cp template.pdf ../manuscript.pdf || echo "Template.pdf not there."
         git clean -xf

    zip: # Remove the zip archive otherwise deleted files will remain in the archive and it will be simply updated
         rm ../manuscript.zip ../figures.zip || echo "No existing zip archive to delete."
         zip ../manuscript.zip -r *
         zip ../figures.zip -r figures/*
         echo "Verify that the pdf and zip archives have been updated by checking their update time."
         ls -lh ../*.zip
	     ls -lh ../*.pdf

## Pipe

Pipe the output of ls to grep

    ls | grep ".md$"

When the command doesn't read from stdin by default, use xargs

    echo README.md | xargs ls -lah
    ls -a | xargs realpath

Based on an [explanation of xargs and pipes](https://superuser.com/a/890349/419414).
When piped to cat, this command simply displays the text "README.md"

    echo README.md | cat

Using `xargs`, the output of echo is interpreted as a file name

    echo README.md | xargs cat

## Try catch

[Is there a try catch command in
bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22009364/is-there-a-try-catch-command-in-bash)

> There is no try/catch in bash; however, one can achieve similar behavior using && or ||.

> Using ||: if command1 fails then command2 runs as follows

    command1 || command2

> Similarly, using &&, command2 will run if command1 is successful

| E               |                 | prepend tracks to the play queue     |


Commands can be sent through a command line with cmus-remote, for example
to pause a running instance of cmus (and restart it):

    cmus-remote -C player-pause

I use this in the pomodoro gnome app to pause music at breaks.

There is a feedback of all the currently active options at the bottom right of
the cums screen.

### Playlist

Create a playlist file, in bash

    find -name '*.ogg'> playlist.m3u

Open a playlist in the playlist view (4), in the cmus command pane

    :load playlist.m3u

Add a song from the library view (2) to the playlist view (4)

    y

Delete a song from the playlist view (4)

    :suppr

Save the modified playlist file

    :save


### Cmus and other audio programs

Some programs such as Skype or MS teams (based on Skype and chromium) turn off
the volume of cmus when entering into a phone call. They sometimes forget to
put it back on. You can turn the volume back on into Gnome's sound
configuration menu, under the applications tab.

# Refactor

[A one liner to replace strings with perl in a git repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21685766/2641825).
The examples below replace all occurrences of the first string with the second string, for all 
files under git version control. 

    git grep -lz 'first_string'| xargs -0 perl -i'' -pE "s/first_string/second_string/g"
    git grep -lz 'readcsvfromgauss'| xargs -0 perl -i'' -pE "s/readcsvfromgauss/readcsvfromgauss0/g"
    git grep -lz 'RMySQL::'| xargs -0 perl -i'' -pE "s/RMySQL::/RMariaDB::/g"

Alias to refactor:

    refactor() {
        echo "Replacing $1 by $2 in all files in this git repository."
        git grep -lz $1| xargs -0 perl -i'' -pE "s/$1/$2/g"
    }

When there are slashes in the patterns, use another separator

    refactor() {

Usage, for example replace 'word' with 'sword':

    refactor word sword
    git diff

## SSH Secure Shell

### Generate SSH keys and add them to the agent

Mon Sep 28 09:36:26 CEST 2020
Generate a new key

    cd ~/.ssh
    ssh-keygen <id_rsa_keyname>

Temporarily add a key to ssh

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/<id_rsa_keyname>

List keys

    ssh-add -l

After a restart of the ssh agent

    killall ssh-agent
    eval `ssh-agent`

This key will not be available anymore
to [permanently add a key to the ssh config file](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4246809/2641825) (SO)
Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file:
 
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<id_rsa_keyname>

If the key was generated with a password,and you don't exactly remember the password,
you can [test a few password you might remember with](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23666831/2641825):

    ssh-keygen -y -f <private_key_file_name>

Note if you copy keys from one machine to another, you might 
encounter this error:
[ssh “permissions are too open” error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9270734/ssh-permissions-are-too-open-error)

Change the permission so only the current user has access to the file:

    chmod 600 id_rsa

### Load SSH keys into the remote server

Based on [Install the public key in remote
server](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-linux-unix/)
Once you have an ssh key on your local machine, you need to load it into the
remote server's authorized keys as such: 

    ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server

OR just copy the public key in remote server as authorized_keys in ~/.ssh/ directory:

    scp $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

The remainder of the [cybercity.biz document](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-linux-unix/) explains how to disable the password based login
on a server.

### Check a key's fingerprint

On github, ssh key fingerprints are displayed in md5format.
To display the fingerprint in md5format, enter:

    ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    Host host_name
      user paul
      hostname ip_address 


## GPG signing keys

See also the [communication page](communication.html) on security issues
related to PGP such as the Efail vulnerability. According to several authors
PGP's cryptography is really old and it is probably not the best encryption
tool nowadays. Part of the issue is also related to the fact that email is a
fundamentally unsecure communication tool.

Generate a PGP key

    gpg --gen-key

## Locale
[Debian wiki page on Locale settings](https://wiki.debian.org/Locale)

Display locale settings

    locale

To install new locales, run :

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

SSH forwards locales to the server. 
The server will try to use the given locale, but it might not have them installed.
[Locale variables have no effect in remote shell](https://askubuntu.com/questions/144235/locale-variables-have-no-effect-in-remote-shell-perl-warning-setting-locale-f/144448#144448)

[How do I add a locale to a Ubuntu Server?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/76013/how-do-i-add-locale-to-ubuntu-server)
Check which locales are supported:

    locale -a

add the locales you want (for example ru):

    sudo locale-gen ru_RU
    sudo locale-gen ru_RU.UTF-8

run this update command

    sudo update-locale

## Partitioning and formatting drives

Manipulate the disk partition table 
[See forum post July 21st, 2012, 09:08 AM](https://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2030703.html)

    sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
    d # delete
    w # write table to disk
    sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
    n # create a new partition
    # yes to all default choices
    w # write table to disk

Create a MS-DOS file system for USB drives

    mkfs.vfat -n 'usb_drive_name' -I /dev/sdb1

You can also use the GUI gparted.


### Format a USB drive

Format a USB drive as a FAT 32 partition.

    sudo fdisk -l 
    sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1 
    sudo mkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/mmcblk0

format a USB drive as a FAT 32 partition smaller than the drive size

    sudo mkdosfs -I -F 32 /dev/mmcblk0 $((2*1024*1024))

I used the GUI tool Gparted.
To see if a partition is primary, use the command:
    sudo parted /dev/mmcblk0 # then:
    print

This will print the type (primary or logical) of the partition.

## User activity

### Super user
Start and quit a super user session

    su
    exit 


# Terminal multiplexers

Superuser.com [tmux or screen](https://superuser.com/questions/236158/tmux-vs-screen)


## Screen
I used screen to detach and reattach bash sessions on remote hosts. 
This enabled me to run long algorithms on the remote host.
I could disconnect in the evening from the ssh session 
and reconnect the following morning to check if the algorithm had finished running. 
The advantage of screen is that it is old and available on many systems.

## Tmux

Tmux is under more active development than Screen.

### Sessions

To start a session

    tmux

To start and name a session:

    tmux new -s session_name

To detach from a session:

    tmux detach (CTRL + b + d)

To reattach to a session:

    tmux attach -t session_name

If there is only one session it's enough to call

    tmux attach

To list current sessions:

    tmux list-sessions

To switch to another session:

    tmux switch -t session_name

To delete a session:

    tmux kill-session -t targetSession


### Windows (tabs)

Create a new windows

    tmux new-window (CTRL + b + c)

Move to a window

    tmux select-window -t :0-9 (CTRL + b + 0-9)

Rename the current window

    tmux rename-window (CTRL + b + ,)

### Panes (splits)

Zoom a pane and de-zoom it:

   z

### Movements

To scroll inside a pane press

    CTRL + b + Page up down


### tmux configuration

[This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21033340/2641825)
explains how to create a tmux source-file. 
The configuration file tells tmux to create windows and panes 
and to start programs in each one of them.
I started to create a tmux source file to start my favorite programs:
A particular setup I use forces me to start these GUI programs from a command line:

    neww
    split-window -v 'lyx'  
    split-window -v 'jabref'  
    split-window -h 'rstudio' 
    new-window

Start tmux with this configuration file:

    tmux new-session -s work "tmux source-file ~/.tmux/work"      

Make it a bash alias, by adding the following line to ~/.bashrc:

    alias tmuxw='tmux new-session -s work "tmux source-file ~/.tmux/work"'

Reddit [discussion on vim splits and tmux tabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/600frr/tmux_tabs_splits_workflow/)

Reload the tmux configuration file

    source-file ~/.tmux.conf

I simply copie the tmux side of the configuration here: 

Smart pane switching with awareness of Vim splits.

## Countdown timer

A [superuser question](https://superuser.com/questions/611538/is-there-a-way-to-display-a-countdown-or-stopwatch-timer-in-a-terminal)
gives a basic loop

    N=100; while [[ $((--N)) >  0 ]]; do echo $N && sleep 1; done

There are many more elaborate answers under that question. 
One of them suggests the python based termdown

    pip3 install termdown
    termdown 10
    termdown 25m


# Users

## Manage users and groups

Check your user id

    id 
    echo $UID
    echo $USER

What group do you belong to as a user

    groups

Add a new user

    useradd username

Set a password for the new user

    passwd username 

Delete a user

    userdel username

Temporary log in as a given user

    su username

Add a user to the super users

    adduser username sudo

That user needs to re-log into the shell for the change to take effect.

Show all users

    getent passwd

Show all groups

    getent group 


## List users and groups

List all users

    less /etc/passwd

List all groups

    less /etc/group
    getent group

List all groups a user is a member of
    
    groups paul

List all members of a group

    getent group www-data
    getent group sudo


## Change file permission

Change user and group of a file

    chown groupname:username filename

Change user and group of all files in a folder, recursively

    # In one command
    sudo chown -R paul:paul scenarios
    # In two commands
    sudo chown -R paul scenarios
    sudo chgrp -R paul scenarios

Change file permission

    chmod a=rwx filename
    chmod 777 filename # all permissions to every one

Change file permissions recursively:

    chmod 755 directoryname # all permissions to the user, only read and execute for other users
    sudo chmod -R 770 scenarios

[nice illustration](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58449179/2641825)
of read, write execute permission codes on Linux. 

Chmod instructions can be given with characters or numbers, chmod 777 or chmod a=rwx is a question of preference.

    Some prefer 755 over 777 because giving write access to group and other users could be a security risk. 755 leaves read and execute rights to groups and other users. 755 is visible as "rwxr-xr-x" in ls -l. 
    The default for document files on Debian seems to be chmod 644, visible as "-rw-r--r--" in ls -l.


## Make the bash shell by default for a user

[No path, or command history through SSH when logged in to server as someone other than 
root](https://superuser.com/questions/904425/no-path-or-command-history-through-ssh-when-logged-in-to-server-as-someone-othe/904485#904485)

Edit the users file

    sudo vim /etc/passwd

Change

    paul:x:1000:1000::/home/paul:/bin/sh

to

    paul:x:1000:1000::/home/paul:/bin/bash


# VPN

A VPN was useful when:

* SMS interface didn't work on orange.fr. I could access it through a VPN server based in Paris.
* FTP download site based in Canada didn't work from Italy. A colleague could access it through a VPN server based in Canada.
* SSH access to remote servers didn't work on company wifi. I could access the machines through the VPN.

VPN access also removes localisation of site searches on google and google maps. 

Example session,from a company wifi system which is probably blocking SSH traffic.
The SSH connection breaks:

    paul@debianpaul:~/repos$ ssh cbm1 
    ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host

I start the VPN:

    paul@debianpaul:~/repos$ vpn connect
    Connecting to France - Paris - 1...     100.0%                       
    Connected to France - Paris - 1

I try to reconnect to that server through SSH:

    paul@debianpaul:~/repos$ ssh cbm1 
    The authenticity of host '[.......eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com] ([__IP__])' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PTwO1p7Q3XqPE4Gs+KH37XqH88ePDYh5bNqKXyVpGAE.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[......eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com],[....]' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

Now the connection works. 

Some VPN access points caused issues when connecting to the corporate email
server and intranet. The connection was blocked for the access point in Milan,
Italy. 
It did work when using the access point in Strasbourg, France. 

The access point from Strasbourg prevented access to Elsevier publications.
With the message:
> "There was a problem providing the content you requested "

I complained to <nlinfo@elsevier.com> and received the following message::

> Dear Paul Thank you for your patience. My colleagues have informed me that
> the IP 92.118.13.115 where you are accessing from has been tagged with high

Changing the VPN location to Frankfurt allowed me to see these Elsevier
publications again.
