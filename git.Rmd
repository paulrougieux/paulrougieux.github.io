# Introduction
This page is the continuation of 
[my blog post on git commands](https://paulremote.blogspot.de/2013/10/git-commands.html).

My typical git use consists in archiving file modifications for personal
projects. Sometimes I share these projects with a colleague. We are then 2
persons working concurrently on the same project, pushing and pulling changes
several times per day. 


## Simple workflow for one user

We suppose someone has helped you initialise a git repository. Before you
modify files, get the latest version of files from the remote repository:

    git pull

Work and modify files in the folder. At some point, when your work has reached
a certain status, you might want to archive it before you move on to something
else. The few commands below tell git to archive the work. 

Show which files have been modified in the folder under git control: 

    git status

Add a file to be committed 

    git add filename

Or add all files:

    git add --all

Note: you might use a graphical git client with check boxes to add the files to
be committed. Commit and describe changes

    git commit -m "describe changes made to those files"
    
Now you can continue working and changing files. Repeat the `git add --all` and
`git commit -m "describe changes"` each time your reach a consistant change
status. Before you leave your computer, push the content to the remote
repository with:

    git push

In case you work with other people on this remote repository, Before you push,
you might want to integrate work done by others in your repository. If any new
work has been added by others on the remote repository, git will ask you to
first do:

    git pull 

and then:

    git push

This simple work flow works well for one user pulling from- and pushing to- a
master branch on a remote repository.

Sometimes the vi editor starts. To exit the vi editor:

    ESC:q!


## Workflow with branches

Initialise a new repository
    
    git init
    
Change to the development branch
    
    # If the branch doesn't exist, create it first.
    git branch develop
    git checkout develop

Work and modify files in the folder. 
At some point, when your work has reached a certain status, you might want to archive it before you move on to something else. The few commands below tell git to archive the work. 
All file modifications will be archived with a commit hash which is a unique key describing your changes.
The most important part is entering a commit message, it should be sufficiently general to describe your changes with a high level of abstraction and sufficiently specific to be understood amoung all other changes later.

First show which files have been modified in the folder under git control: 

    git status

Add a file to be committed 

    git add filename
    # Add all files
    git add --all
    
Commit and describe changes

    git commit -m "describe changes made to those files"
    
Now you can continue working and changing files. 
Repeat the `git add --all` and `git commit -m "describe changes"` each time your reach a 
consistant change status.

At some point you will be ready to upload your content to a remote archive. 
Merge to the master branch

    git checkout master
    git merge develop
    
Push contents to the remote repository

    git push

See below how to set-up the remote repository with `git remote add origin ssh:repositoryurl` and pushing content for the first time with `git push -u origin master`.

Check status again 

    git status
    
Go back to the development branch

    git checkout develop

Continue to modify files in the repository.

# Add and commit

## Add patterns

Add modified markdown files to the next git commit

    git add *.md

The star * is a [file glob
pattern](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt-ltpathspecgt82308203)
that matches all other path components in between.


## Commit messages

Example of a long commit message (like a letter) torvalds/uemacs [Stop using
'short' for line and allocation sizes
](https://github.com/torvalds/uemacs/commit/fa00fe882f719351fdf7a4c4100baf4f3eab4d61). 

Extract:

> "I really should just learn another editor, rather than continue to polish
> this turd."


# Autocompletion

git has an [auto complete](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks#Auto-Completion) 
feature available in a script: `git-completion.bash`.

That script can be loaded in bashrc at the start of the shell.
A debian package was made to simply load git-completion.bash for you:

    sudo apt install bash-completion


# Branching

To start work in a new branch:

    git branch new_branch_name
    git checkout new_branch_name

To compare a file between 2 branches:

    git diff branch1 branch2 file_name

To compare the tip of 2 branches

    git diff branch1..branch2

To merge changes back to the master branch:

    git checkout master

    git merge branch1

If there were conflicts, they will be presented in this way:

    "The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the ======= is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side."



If I am on a detached head, it is recommended to create a temporary branch (stackoverflow).

    git branch temp

    git checkout temp

    git add -a

    git  commit -m "description of changes"

    git checkout master

    git merge temp

Delete uncommitted changes in current working directory:

    git checkout branch_name .

See also below git clean.


Add minor change to the previous commit (git commit --amend):

    git commit --amend

I use to have this branching strategy:

> I never work in the master branch, always in a development branch called
> `develop`. I merge `develop` in `master`, only before pushing modifications
> back to my remote archive. This simple branching strategy makes it much
> easier to deal with potential changes in the remote master branch.

But I have now changed to a simpler strategy where I work only on the master branch. 



## Delete a branch

I might need to delete a branch at some point:

    git branch -d branch_name 

Delete a remote branch

    git push --delete origin branch_name

# Configuring git 

## Configuring user name and email

Display your user name, email and remote repositories

    git config -l

To change username and email globally

    git config --global user.name "Your Name" 

    git config --global user.email you@example.com

Stackoverflow [git multiple user names for different projects](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9063238/2641825)
explains how to change the email for the current repository only

    git config user.email personal@example.org

## Other config --global options

[How do I make Git use the editor of my choice for commits?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2596835/2641825)

    git config --global core.editor "vim"

## Remembering passwords

[How to save user name and password in git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35942754/how-to-save-username-and-password-in-git)

    git config credential.helper store

Alternativelly, it's better to use ssh keys to connect to git repositories.

# Display changes

To view modified files that have not been committed and to view commit history you can use: 

    git status
    git log

    git log --pretty=oneline 

Shows the changes between the working directory and the index.

    git diff

Shows the changes between the index and the HEAD

    git diff --cached

Shows all the changes between the working directory and HEAD

    git diff HEAD

The 3 lines above were copied from this question on git diff.

Show which change happened in a particular commit 

    git show <commit-hash>

Show when the tip of branches have been updated

    git reflog

 Alternatively, call the repository browser with:

    gitk

To view a shorter version of the log file, and get an idea at where I am in the history:

    git log --graph --decorate --all --pretty=oneline

You can define an alias for git log as explained be Fred here:

    git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset' --abbrev-commit" 

The new alias can then be used with

    git lg 

Use tags to specify important points in history, such as software versions.


## Blame

To see the commit number and author of each line in a file use

    git blame filename




# Illustrations

[Data flows and storage levels in the Git revision control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Git_operations.svg).

# .gitignore

To ignore all files in a folder but not the folder itself. Put this .gitignore into the folder, then git add .gitignore

    *
    !.gitignore

 To exclude everything except a specific directory foo/bar (note the /* - without the slash, the wildcard would also exclude everything within foo/bar):

    /*
    !/foo
    /foo/*
    !/foo/bar


# .gitkeep

[So question how can I add a blank directory to a git repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-a-blank-directory-to-a-git-repository)

some answers suggest using `.gitkeep` or simply `.keep` because files starting
with ".git" should be reserved for git usage. 


# Git run to automate many repositories

Git run enables to pull from many repositories with a single command  

configuration was a bit complicated on debian

Install nodejs and npm from the backports

    sudo apt -t stretch-backports install nodejs
    sudo apt -t stretch-backports install npm
    sudo apt install build-essential

Configure nmp to run only for the local user
[configure npm to use a different directory](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40905762/2641825)
citing 
docs.npmjs.com [Manually change npm’s default directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory)

in your home directory, create a directory for global installations:

    mkdir ~/.npm-global

Configure npm to use the new directory path:

    npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

Install Git run:

    npm install -g git-run

Edit your bash profile:

    vim ~/.bash_aliases
    
and add this line:

    export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH

Then the configuration file is a .json file on the home folder. 
Edit it: 

    vim ~/.grconfig.json

For example:

    {
      "tags": {
        "all": [
          "/home/paul/repos/bioeconomy_notes",
          "/home/paul/repos/bioeconomy_papers",
          "/home/paul/repos/cbm3_python",
          "/home/paul/repos/cbmcfs3_data",
          "/home/paul/repos/cbmcfs3_pub",
          "/home/paul/repos/cbmcfs3_runner",
        ]
      }
    }


Show the status and pull from many repos:

    gr git status
    gr git pull


# Going back in time 

## Log

Display the modification log

    git log 

In the log, you can copy the beginning of a commit hash for use as `commit_sha` in the reset commands below.

Display the log of a particular branch (after a fetch for example)

    git log origin/master 

Display the log of a particular file

    git log path/filename

Display a compact log for one file or one directory only

    git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline path_to_file

Edit `~/.gitconfig` to define an alias that shows the last 10 log entries in a compact way:

    lkj    = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(cyan)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit -10

This alias also works with the log of one file only

    git lkj path/filename


### Show commit statistics

Show the number of lines modified in each files for each commit: 

    git log --numstat 

A one liner version showing the number of files changes, number of lines inserted
and deleted [how to get log with short stat in one line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21137477/how-to-get-git-log-with-short-stat-in-one-line):

    git log --pretty="@%h"  --shortstat |  tr "\n" " " | tr "@" "\n"

### Export the log to csv

SO [Export git log as
csv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418056/how-do-i-generate-a-git-commit-log-for-the-last-month-and-export-it-as-csv/10418356):

    git log --pretty=format:'%h,%an,%ad,"%s"' --date=iso -10

Edit `~/.gitconfig` to define it as an alias:

    logcsv = log --pretty=format:'%h,%an,%ad,\"%s\"' --date=iso

Another version adding stats on the number of files changes, number of lines
inserted and deleted based on [how to get log with short stat in one line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21137477/how-to-get-git-log-with-short-stat-in-one-line):

    git log --pretty=format:'linebegin%h,%an,%ad,"%s"' --shortstat --date=iso |  tr "\n" "," | sed -E 's/linebegin|,*$/\n/g'

Simpler solution using paste to glue lines together (there is an issue with
extra spaces at the beginning and in the middle of some lines):

    git log --pretty=format:'%h,%an,%ad,"%s",' --shortstat --date=iso | paste - - - #> /tmp/gitlog.csv


### Tig

The tig utility is a repository browser for git log and git diff.


## Rewriting history

In case you entered a wrong commit message, you can edit the last commit message with:

    git commit --amend 

In case you forgot a file, you can add a file to the last commit with:

    git add filename
    git commit --amend

A comment in [How to change past commit to include a missed file?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14369155/how-to-change-past-commit-to-include-a-missed-file) 
specifies that commits before and after `--amend` have different hashes, 
even if only the commit message is changed. 
The use of `--amend` is only for private commits, which have not yet
been shared with others. 

Rewriting commits older than the previous one is much harder.
It requires the use of git rebase. 
I regularly want to fix typo in the git log, but it is not possible
it was made unflexible on purpose.
Explained in this [Stackoverflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/457396/2641825)

> "The real reason git doesn't allow you to change the commit message ends up being very simple: that way, you can trust the messages. If you allowed people to change them afterwards, the messages are inherently not very trustworthy." 


### Rebase

It is safe to use rebase as long as the commits have not been pushed 
to another repository. 
To rename older commits, simply run:

    git rebase -i
    git rebase -i @~9   # Show the last 9 commits in a text editor

Rebase will show the last 3 commits by default in the vim editor.
Each line starts with "pick" followed by the commit hash and commit message. 
You can then replace the "pick" word in the vim editor by the command
you want to achieve, press "escape", ":wq" and peform the git command on the selected commit.

See also :

 * Answers to a StackOverflow question  
[How to modify a specified commit?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1186535/how-to-modify-a-specified-commit).
 * [10 things I hate about git](https://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/) Translation of the man page which he considers hard to understand: "git-rebase – Sequentially regenerate a series of commits so they can be applied directly to the head node"


## Clean

Remove all files also those not tracked by git because they are in .gitignore.
For example output pdf files and auxiliary files generated from latex or from pandoc.

    git clean -xf

Remove local (untracked) files from my current Git branch

Show what will be deleted with the -n option:

    git clean -f -n

Then - beware: this will delete files - run:

    git clean -f 

Alternatively clean in interactive mode:

    git clean -i


## Reset whole folder

Identify the commit identity in the log and copy its sha number. 
Then to go back to this state for the whole folder: 

    git reset --hard commit_sha

Do this **before pushing** only!

Once you have pushed the changes, you need to revert the commit and commit
those changes as well:

    git revert -m 1 HEAD~
    git revert commit_sha

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9804211/can-not-push-changes-after-using-git-reset-hard

Use the begining of a `commit_sha` copied from the log.


To remove a commit where I accidentaly commited a very large file.
I used [how to remove a too large file in a commit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39768343/2641825):

    git reset HEAD^

Then added the large file to .gitignore and committed again. 

## Reset only one file

To go back to this state for only one file, see git checkout

    git checkout commit_hash  path_to_file/file_name

No need to enter the commit hash to get to get the file from the latest commit

    git checkout path_to_file/file_name

Checkout the older revision of a file under a new name

    git show commit_sha:filename > new_file_name

See also alias and git grep below.


## Revert

Revert an unwanted commit with a new commit doing exactly the reverse operation

    git revert <commit hash>


# GUI Graphical User Interface

For colleagues who need a GUI: 

- http://gitextensions.github.io/ recommended on [this SO
  answer](http://gitextensions.github.io/)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

A section of the git book on [Graphical User
Interfaces](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Graphical-Interfaces)
describes the default git-gui and gitk graphical user interfaces to prepare
commits and view the git log history. It also describes the github desktop
client and in particular it's "sync" feature:

> "The main way you interact with other repositories over the network is
> through the “Sync” feature. Git internally has separate operations for
> pushing, fetching, merging, and rebasing, but the GitHub clients collapse all
> of these into one multi-step feature. Here’s what happens when you click the
> Sync button:
>
>     git pull --rebase. If this fails because of a merge conflict, fall back to git pull --no-rebase.
>     git push.
>
> This is the most common sequence of network commands when working in this
> style, so squashing them into one command saves a lot of time. "

## Gitlab


### Issue triage


On the Gitlab labels page: 

> "Labels can be applied to issues and merge requests. Star a label to make it
> a priority label. Order the prioritized labels to change their relative
> priority, by dragging."

[Issue triage by priority](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#priority)

| Priority       | Importance | Intention                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~priority::1` | Urgent     | We will address this as soon as possible regardless of the limit on our team capacity.             |
| `~priority::2` | High       | We will address this soon and will provide capacity from our team for it in the next few releases. |
| `~priority::3` | Medium     | We want to address this but may have other higher priority items.                                  |
| `~priority::4` | Low        | We don't have visibility when this will be addressed.                                              |


### CI Continuous Integration

By default, job artifacts are not kept on failure. 
To enable this add a `when` clause to `.gitlab-ci.yaml`

      artifacts:
        when: always
        paths:
        - notebooks


#### Usage quotas

Check usage quotas for a group at (replace group_name by the actual group name):

# Line endings

[How to renormalize line endings in all files in all revisions?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7156694/git-how-to-renormalize-line-endings-in-all-files-in-all-revisions)

    git add --renormalize .

This is usually taken care of at the system level. But sometimes when you share
files with windows machines (accessing them on a shared folder for example) you
end up with commits that show a lot of modifications because the windows line
ending LRLF appears in the linux machine. [Configuring git to handle line
endings](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings)
To force the line ending to be LF only, create a  .gitattributes file which
contains: 

    text eol=lf


# Publishing project documentation 

## On Github

Older content related to pages built from branches.

SO answer to the question "How to add a git repo as a submodule of itself? (Or:
How to generate GitHub Pages programmatically?)": An alternative to using Git
Submodules to generate GitHub Pages is to use Git Subtree Merge Strategy.

In fact I didn't use quite that strategy and I instead cloned a temporary copy
of my repository. Created the gh-page  branch. Pushed it to github. Then I went
back to the original repository (where I have a few large untracked data files
I find handy to keep for analyses purposes).

Then within the inst folder, I cloned only the gh-branch. To clone only one
branch:

    git clone -b mybranch --single-branch git://sub.domain.com/repo.git

Then I renamed the folder to "web", so that I had a inst/web folder, tracking
the gh-branch. inst/web is ignored in the main repository.


## On Gitlab

Gitlab has an integrated CI mechanism, 
* [Create a pages website by using a CI / CD 
  template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started/pages_ci_cd_template.html)
* [Rendering an R markdown presentation to gitlab

# Remote

[Add a remote repository](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#git-remote-emaddem)
with:

    git remote add git@github.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.github.io.git
    # or
    git remote add reponame https://repositoryurl 

[Change the url of a remote repository](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#git-remote-emset-urlem)

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.github.io.git

When a repository is connected to several remote repositories, 
you can push content to repositories by specifying their names

    git push -u origin master
    git push -u anotherrepository master

To change the default git remote, push with :

    git push -u origin master

Then later push of that branch to that remote can be made simply with:

    git push

Another command without specifying the remote and the branch

    $ git push -u

    fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
    To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
        git push --set-upstream origin master

After I run this set upstream flag, I can push to the remote server. Then I get this message

    [...]
     * [new branch]      master -&gt; masterBranch master set up to track remote branch master from origin. 

I'll have to figure out what this does.

## Push to multiple remotes

Based on [this blog post](https://jigarius.com/blog/multiple-git-remote-repositories)
I added the push remote twice to the origin repo as such :

    git remote set-url --add --push origin  git@gitlab.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.git
    git remote set-url --add --push origin  git@github.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.github.io.git

The output of git push -v shows that it is now pushing to both repositories

    git push -v
    Pushing to git@gitlab.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.git
    To gitlab.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.git
     = [up to date]      master -> master
    updating local tracking ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master'
    Everything up-to-date
    Pushing to git@github.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.github.io.git
    To github.com:paulrougieux/paulrougieux.github.io.git
     = [up to date]      master -> master
    updating local tracking ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master'
    Everything up-to-date


## Pull rebase versus merge

[Explanation on rebase versus
merge](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/Git_pull_--rebase_vs._--merge)

> "If you pull remote changes with the flag --rebase, then your local changes
> are **reapplied on top** of the remote changes."

    git pull --rebase

> "If you pull remote changes with the flag --merge, which is also the default,
> then your local changes are merged with the remote changes. This results in a
> **merge commit** that points to the latest local commit and the latest remote
> commit."

    git pull --merge

> "It is best practice to always rebase your local commits when you pull before
> pushing them."

This can be set as a global configuration with 

    git config --global pull.rebase true


# Rename and delete files

Rename a file

    git mv file_name file_name_new

Change the case of a file on a windows FAT 32 system:

    git mv load.r load2.R
    git mv load2.R load.R

If a file or folder has been renamed outside of git, I get this warning:

    $ git add .
    warning: You ran 'git add' with neither '-A (--all)' or '--ignore-remo
    whose behaviour will change in Git 2.0 with respect to paths you removed
    Paths like 'docs/efi/efi_logo_rgb_small_siw.jpg' that are
    removed from your working tree are ignored with this version of Git.

    * 'git add --ignore-removal ', which is the current default,
      ignores paths you removed from your working tree.

    * 'git add --all ' will let you also record the removals.

Therefore I think I should always run "git add --all" after I have removed or
renamed files.


# Replace and search text

## Searching text with grep

Search all files in the subdirectory "subdir" for lines containing the words "factor" and "item". Show 2 lines of context (2 leading and 2 trailing lines).

    git grep -e item --and -e factor -C 2 -- subdir/

Search all R markdown files containing the word lyx ignore the case:

    git grep -i lyx -- *.Rmd

Stackoverflow:  [How to search committed code in the git
history?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928584/how-to-grep-search-committed-code-in-the-git-history)

Search in all possible locations in all commits

    git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all)

Search for a particular location in the git repo

    git grep <regexp> $(git rev-list --all -- lib/util) -- lib/util

The above grep commands will give you a list of commit sha where the grep
pattern was present in the repo. You can then checkout the older revision of a
file under a new name

    git show commit_sha:filename > new_file_name


### Searching for two terms on the same line


For example:

    git grep -e module_dir --and -e "import"


## Replacing strings

Use git grep to replace strings in many files in the directory :

    git grep -l 'original_text' | xargs sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g'

See also the refactor function in the [bash](bash.html) page.

# Tagging

Creating an annotated tag

    git tag -a v1.4 -m 'my version 1.4'
    git tag v0.0.2  -m "Version 0.0.2"

A regular push command won't push a tag (bitbucket), to push all your tags :

    git push origin --tags

List tags

    git tag -l

You can add a tag after the fact. To tag an earlier commit, specify the commit checksum or part of it:

    git log --pretty=oneline

    git tag -a v1.2 -m 'version 1.2' 9fceb02

Delete a tag

    git tag -d tag_name

To delete a tag on the remote server as well

    git push --delete origin tagname

Return all files in the repository to a particular tag:

    git checkout tags/v0.1

Optionally you can checkout and create a new branch to commit your changes with:

    git checkout tags/o.1 -b newbranchname

Git tools [signing your work](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)Signed tags
Generate a pgp key

    gpg --gen-key

# TO DO lists

In one repo:

    git grep TODO

In multiple repos (using git run):

    gr git grep "^TODO "


# Uploading content to online git platforms

Git is useful as a version management on its own. 
But it's even more usefull when code can be back-up online. 
 * Free public git storage is availble on [Github](http://github.com/). 
 * Free public and private git storage are available on 
   [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/),
   with up to 5 collaborators per project.
 * Free public and private git storage are available on 
   [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/).

Commands I've used to upload content to an existing repository github.com/paul4forest/forestproductsdemand are:
```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/paul4forest/forestproductsdemand
    git pull origin master
    git add
    git commit -m "Explanatory message"
    git push origin master
```

Commands to upload content to a fresh repository from bitbucket :
```
    mkdir /path/to/your/project
    cd /path/to/your/project
    git init
    git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.org/username/bbreponame.git
    # Upload and set the local changes as upstream
    git push -u origin master
```
See also this discussion on [why do I need to set upstream](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6089294/why-do-i-need-to-do-set-upstream-all-the-time)?

Commands to copy an existing repository from bitbucket :

     git clone git@bitbucket.org/username/bbreponame.git

## Setting up SSH keys 

See [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
and [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

To test if my new ssh key worked with github, 
I created a branch and pushed it to github.
Then I deleted the branch locally and remotely:

	git branch "key"
	git checkout key
	git push --set-upstream origin key
	# Checked that the "key" branch became visible on github
	git checkout master
	git branch -d key
	git push origin --delete key


# Stash to Keep uncommitted changes in the current branch while working quickly in another branch

For example you edit a file in branch develop

    git checkout develop
    echo "blabla" > newfile.txt

Imagine you are in the middle of your work and need to do an urgent modification in 
another branch. 
To move to another branch, you would normaly need to commit this change.
If you don't want to commit the change yet.
You can store temporary changes with the command:

    git stash

Move to the master branch

    git checkout master
    # perform important operation in the master branch.

Get back to the develop branch and reload uncommited changes

    git checkout develop
    git stash pop


# Subversion

Subversion is another version control system. 
It is different than git and should be on another page, but since I don't expect to use it very much,
it probably makes sense to keep a Subversion section under the git page here.
See also wiki.debian.org [small SVN tutorial](https://wiki.debian.org/SmallSVNTutorial).

Install subversion from the Debian repository

    sudo apt install subversion

Load the latest version of some repository

    svn checkout --username yourusername http://repositoryurl

Get help on a command

    svn help log

See the last 4 log entries

    svn log -l 4

Bring changes from the repository HEAD into the working copy

    svn up

synchronize working copy to revision given by -r.    
    
    svn up -r10860

show the status 

    svn status

show differences

    svn diff
