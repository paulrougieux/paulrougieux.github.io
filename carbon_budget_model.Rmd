# Introduction

- The [Carbon Budget
  Model](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107)
  was developed by the forest carbon accounting team of the Canadian Forest
  Service. 

    - [libcbm model](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py) is an updated
      version that can run as a python package. It was also developed by Forest
      Carbon Accounting team of the Canadian Forest Service.

- The forest carbon model
  [eu_cbm_hat](https://gitlab.com/bioeconomy/eu_cbm/eu_cbm_hat) is a python
  package that enables the assessment of forest CO2 emissions and removals
  under scenarios of forest management, natural disturbances, forest-related
  land use changes. 

    - `eu_cbm_hat` depends on the [libcbm
      model](https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py) developed by Forest Carbon
      Accounting team of the Canadian Forest Service.

    - It uses [pandas data frames](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to transform and
      load data.
